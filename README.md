# Music Player Version 2.0
This is my first music project using C++ and SDL libraries such as SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image. This is definately a non-finished project so far but is still being worked on occasionally. This is a non-commerical use project and is 100% free to use but if you do use any of my source please give me credit, thank you!

Hotkeys:
  1. F1 - Play
  2. F2 - Stop
  3. F3 - Pause/Resume

Music player buttons now work! You can still use your hotkeys of course.
___

Small appearence update and also removed the event handler from the button class and made use of events in the main application class.
